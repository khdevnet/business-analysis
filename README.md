# Business analysis

### Scope Models
Used to organize thoughts on feature sets, functional capabilities, and scope of work       
Primarily focused on higher-level generation and understanding of requirements
##### Goal & Business Objective Models
(Goals, Problems, Objectives, Success Metrics, High-Level Features)
Problems and objectives tied together to represent creation of value        
Value may be represented by increased revenues, decreased costs, higher quality, greater risk resilience, etc.      
Indicates why objectives are important, helpful in prioritizing selection/resources

##### Ecosystem Maps
(Shows systems and their relationships, May indicate how data moves, Systems in scope and those impacted by or impacting data should be included)

##### Context Diagrams
(Shows both system and human interfaces, Indicates scope of project and where new work may be needed to meet objectives, System in development at center shown, as a circle; systems and people as boxes; lines indicate data movement)

##### Feature Models
(Hierarchical representation of all features, Features may encompass several related requirements, Up to three levels typically used in model, Color differences may be used to represent current status of features)

##### Use Case Diagrams
(Represents ways users interact with the system, and for what purposes; Typically, use cases in circles connect to figures representing types of users; Multiple users may be tied to multiple use cases)

### Process Models
Focused on how processes complete work and meet objectives      
Analyzes how stakeholders interact with, impact, and are impacted by, processes
* Process flows
* Use cases
* User stories

### Rule Models
Focused on ensuring business policies are adhered to by defining and limiting acceptable actions        
Rules may be internal, contractual, Rule Models regulatory, legal, etc.

### Data Models
Determines how, when, and where data is obtained        
Outlines how data is used in systems and processes      
* Entity relationship diagrams
* Data flow diagrams
* Data dictionaries
* State tables
* State diagrams

### Interface Models
Focused on making specific systems morecomprehensible and relevant      
Addresses how systems are integrated and how they contribute to objectives
* Report tables
* System interface tables
* User interface flows
* Wireframes
* Display-action-response models

# The Language of Modeling
* Shorthand, symbols, standardized notation methods all common in modeling        
* Specific languages used vary by organization and project        
* Consistency is key, regardless of language 
* Develop definitions and use shapes and colors in commonly understood ways
